             <h2>Amul- The Taste Of India</h2>
             <p>Amul is an Indian dairy state government cooperative society, based at Anand in Gujarat. Formed in 1946, it is a cooperative brand managed by the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. (GCMMF), which today is jointly controlled by 36 lakh milk producers in Gujarat, and the apex body of 13 district milk unions, spread across 13,000 villages of Gujarat. Amul spurred India's White Revolution, which made the country the world's largest producer of milk and milk products. Word AMUL stands for Anand Milk Union Limited.

                Tribhuvandas Kishibhai Patel under the guidance of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel became the founding chairman of the organization and led it until his retirement in the 70s. He hired Verghese Kurien in 1949 and convinced him to stay and help with the mission. Under the chairmanship of Tribhuvandas, Kurien was initially the general manager and helped guide the technical and marketing efforts of Amul. Kurien was the chairman of Amul briefly after Tribhuvandas Kishibhai Patel died in 1994. Kurien, founder-chairman of the GCMMF for more than 30 years (1973â€“2006), is credited with the success of Amul's marketing.

                <p>The GCMMF is the largest food products marketing organization in India. It is the apex organization of the dairy cooperatives of Gujarat. It is the exclusive marketing organization for products under the brand name Amul and Sagar. Over the last five and a half decades, dairy cooperatives in Gujarat have created an economic network that links more than 3.1 million (3.1  million) village milk products with crores of consumers in India. In 2007, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd crossed US$ 1 billion in its sales turnover and entered the elite club of food companies having this distinction from India. In one more major achievement, the dairy cooperatives of Gujarat under the GCMMF fold crossed milk procurement of 10 million kgs. per day mark on 27 December 2007, which is the highest ever milk procurement achieved by any dairy network in India, be it private or cooperative. The entire quantity of milk received was accepted without any milk holidays and was processed successfully into milk and other milk products.</p>
               <p>In 1966, Amul hired Sylvester da Cunha, the managing director of an advertising agency as to design an ad campaign for Amul Butter. DaCunha designed a campaign as a series of hoardings with topical ads, relating to day-to-day issues.[23] It was popular and earned a Guinness World Record for the longest-running ad campaign in the world. In the 1980s, cartoon artist Kumar Morey and scriptwriter Bharat Dabholkar had been involved in sketching the Amul ads; the latter rejected the trend of using celebrities in advertisement campaigns. Dabholkar credited chairman Verghese Kurien with creating a free atmosphere that fostered the development of the ads.In August 2019, Amul became the first Indian dairy company to enter Rabobank's Global Top 20 Dairy Companies list.</p></section>
